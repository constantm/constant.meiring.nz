# Hello there!

My name is Constant, and I've spent the past fiteen years shipping successful products to market as a software engineer, product manager and people leader. I operate well in ambigious, fast-paced environments.

## üì¶ Product

Shipping a successful product is hard, and the risk of failure is ever present. However, these risks can be managed, increasing your chances of success.

- Fall in love with your problems, not with your solutions.
- Validate that there is a market demand by running data-driven experiments.
- Make sure the economics check out.
- Agile is a not a thing, but a way of doing things.

See my list of product opinions [here](https://productmanifesto.tech){:target="\_blank"}.

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering

All business are tech business, the techlogy stack you choose is very important. When it comes down to it, I choose boring tech. I'm a full stack engineer, preferring to work with Ruby/Rails and VueJS where you absolutely need it in the UI.

- Most web applications don't need a SPA and the complexity it brings.
- My goto is Ruby on Rails hosted on a PaaS - again, avoiding dealing with infrastructure complexity.
- Sprinkles of VueJS where the user experience demands it.
- bUt rAiLs dOeSnT sCaLe. Yes it does, see Gitlab, AirBnb and Shopify
- That said, at the end of the day, choose right tool for the job.
